      <h1>Random Stuff People Want to Buy</h1>
      <a href="index.html">Home</a>
    </nav>
    <p>I created this because I was bored and now I have to finish it <br>
    All links in the <b>Home</b> page are mostly picked from the first site that pops up from Google<br>
    All results are focused on best links, and options for ordering in <b>Ghana</b><br>
    There is little to no bias in my selection<br>
    I will frequently update this when I see the need, or feel like it; maybe I'll even create it from scratch<br>
    and design a dynamic page rather than a static one. Learning is a process I guess...</p><br>
    <p>Anyway, hope you like it, and <b>THANK YOU</b> for visiting<br></p>
